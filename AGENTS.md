# AGENTS.md — Enrichment.Inference.Engine

## What This Repo Is

Universal domain-aware entity enrichment API.
Stack: Python 3.12 / FastAPI app surface / SDK transport runtime / Perplexity LLM / Neo4j graph / Redis cache / PostgreSQL state.

## Three Rules Every Agent Must Know

1. **Run `make agent-check` before every commit** — all 7 gates must pass.
2. **Respect your Tier** — see Autonomy Tiers below. T4/T5 changes require human review.
3. **This file is law** — if you see a conflict between documents, AGENTS.md wins.

## Agent Operating Model

This document defines the rules of engagement for AI agents (Manus, Copilot, Cursor, etc.) operating on this repository.

### Autonomy Tiers

| Tier | Scope | Allowed Without Human Review |
|------|-------|------------------------------|
| **T0 — Read-Only** | Browse, index, analyze, report | Always |
| **T1 — Lint & Fix** | Auto-fix lint, formatting, import ordering | Always |
| **T2 — Test & CI** | Add/modify tests, CI config, pre-commit | PR required |
| **T3 — Engine Logic** | Modify `app/engines/`, `app/score/`, `app/health/`, `app/services/` | PR + review required |
| **T4 — Transport Contract** | Modify SDK runtime transport/wiring bundle | PR + 2 reviewers |
| **T5 — Schema** | Modify `app/models/`, `kb/` rule files | PR + 2 reviewers + CI green |

### Protected Files — Never Modify Without Human Review (T4/T5)

| File | Tier | Why |
|------|------|-----|
| `app/main.py` | T4 | SDK runtime bootstrap and transport ingress ownership |
| `app/api/v1/chassis_endpoint.py` | T4 | Transport-adjacent HTTP routes |
| `app/services/chassis_handlers.py` | T4 | Supplemental SDK handler registration |
| `app/engines/orchestration_layer.py` | T4 | Canonical SDK handler registration + cross-node orchestration wiring |
| `app/engines/handlers.py` | T4 | Engine action handlers — must stay aligned with runtime registrations |
| `app/engines/graph_sync_client.py` | T4 | Gate transport contract |
| `app/models/` (all files) | T5 | Pydantic schema — downstream breaking change risk |
| `kb/` rule files | T5 | Knowledge base — requires review + CI green |
| `.github/workflows/` | T2 | CI pipeline integrity |
| `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GUARDRAILS.md` | T4 | Governance documents |
| `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose*.yml` | T3 | Infrastructure immutability |

### Deprecated Compatibility Artifacts

These files are **not** part of the active production transport path and must not be used as the constitutional source of transport behavior:

- `chassis/envelope.py`
- `chassis/router.py`
- `chassis/registry.py`

They may remain in the repo temporarily for compatibility, tests, migration safety, or historical reference. Do not reintroduce them into production dispatch.

### First-Order Thinking Gates

Before any modification, run the 5 Gates:

1. **GATE 1 — Functional before cosmetic.** Does this change make the engine work better, or just look better?
2. **GATE 2 — Scope check.** Is this change within the PR's stated scope?
3. **GATE 3 — Contract preservation.** Does this change break any runtime/graph/score contract?
4. **GATE 4 — Test coverage.** Does this change have corresponding test coverage?
5. **GATE 5 — Rollback safety.** Can this change be reverted without data loss?

## Mandatory Pre-Commit Command

```bash
make agent-check
````

All 7 gates must pass before any commit.

| Gate           | Command                               | Blocks On                                 |

| 2/7 FORMAT     | ruff format --check .                 | Formatting inconsistency                  |
| 3/7 TYPES      | mypy app                              | Type errors (non-blocking per WAIVER-001) |
| 4/7 UNIT TESTS | pytest tests/unit/ tests/compliance/  | Test failure or coverage < 60%            |
| 5/7 CI TESTS   | pytest tests/ci/                      | Contract call enforcement failure         |
| 6/7 AUDIT      | python tools/audit_engine.py --strict | CRITICAL/HIGH rule violations             |
| 7/7 CONTRACTS  | python tools/verify_contracts.py      | Contract manifest integrity failure       |

Quick fix before re-check: `make agent-fix` (auto-fixes ruff lint + format)

---

## CI Requirements

All PRs must pass:

* `make lint` — Ruff + MyPy
* `make test` — pytest with coverage
* `make audit` — 27-rule audit engine
* `make verify` — Contract verification
* Compliance tests (banned patterns, field names, import resolution, architecture)
* Contract call enforcement (repository_contract_pairs.yaml)

## Canonical Import Patterns

```python
# CORRECT — module-level imports, Pydantic v2 runtime safe
from __future__ import annotations

from collections.abc import AsyncIterator
from typing import Any

import structlog
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, model_validator

from constellation_node_sdk.transport import TransportPacket, create_transport_packet
from engine.utils.security import sanitize_label
from engine.utils.neo4j import execute_cypher

# WRONG — never do these
from typing import Optional, List, Dict      # C-05: use T | None, list[T], dict[K,V]
import yaml; yaml.load(...)                  # C-08: always yaml.safe_load()
print("debug")                               # C-04: always structlog
```

## Prohibited Actions

* **Never** reintroduce production dispatch through `chassis/envelope.py`, `chassis/router.py`, or `chassis/registry.py`
* **Never** change SDK transport/runtime ingress semantics without lockstep updates to the active transport bundle
* **Never** add new SDK action registrations without corresponding handler + test
* **Never** introduce FastAPI imports in engine modules outside explicitly allowed transport-adjacent files
* **Never** use `eval()`, `exec()`, `compile()`, `pickle`
* **Never** hardcode API keys, tokens, or secrets
* **Never** use `print()` in engine code (use `structlog`)
* **Never** add `Field(alias=...)` to Pydantic models
* **Never** use camelCase for Python field names
* **Never** modify authentication or authorization logic without review
* **Never** modify `.github/workflows/` without review
* **Never** log API keys, partner data, or LLM responses at INFO level or above

## Agent Modes

### Code Generation

1. Determine your Tier for the files being modified.
2. Check forbidden patterns table before writing.
3. Use canonical import patterns.
4. Run `make agent-check` before committing.
5. Every new public function needs a docstring and type annotations.

### Code Review (PR)

1. Load `AI_AGENT_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md` as primary guide.
2. Check all C-01 through C-21 contracts against changed files.
3. Comment format: `CONTRACT C-{N} VIOLATION — {rule}`.

### Refactoring

1. Confirm the change is within your Tier scope.
2. Verify all changed function signatures still match C-02.
3. Run `make test-compliance` and `make test-contracts` after refactoring.
4. If changing transport/runtime files, verify SDK ingress ownership (C-21) is preserved.

### Question-Answering and Analysis

* T0 operation — always permitted.
* Reference specific section titles and contract IDs in answers.

---

## Agent Capabilities

### Permitted Commands

* `make agent-check` — full gate sequence
* `make agent-fix` — auto-fix lint/format
* `make test`, `make test-unit`, `make test-compliance`, `make test-contracts`
* `make audit`, `make audit-json` — informational audit
* `make verify` — contract verification
* `python tools/audit_engine.py` — direct audit invocation
* `python tools/verify_contracts.py` — direct verification

### Forbidden Commands

* `make prod`, `make prod-build`, `make deploy` — production infrastructure
* `make dev-clean` — destroys volumes
* `docker system prune` — destructive
* `git push --force` or `git reset --hard`
* `alembic upgrade head` in production context
