# Workflow State — Enrichment.Inference.Engine

**Last Updated:** 2026-03-30
**Current Phase:** PHASE 2 — Implementation (Gap Closure)

---

## Context Summary

The Enrichment.Inference.Engine is the Layer 2 ENRICH service in the L9 constellation. It provides:
- Multi-pass convergence loop for AI-powered entity enrichment
- Consensus-based multi-variation LLM synthesis
- Domain KB injection for vertical-specific context
- Inference bridge for deterministic rule firing
- Graph sync for pushing enriched entities to Neo4j

**Recent Major Milestone:** GMP-ENRICH-001 completed — merged consensus-mode enrichment from Enrichment-Deployment-pack into WaterfallEngine with full test coverage.

## Current State

### What's Built and Working

| Component | Status | Files |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Core Enrichment Pipeline | ✅ Production-ready | `waterfall_engine.py`, `enrichment_orchestrator.py` |
| Consensus Engine | ✅ Enhanced | `consensus.py` with `synthesize()`, `merge_with_priority()` |
| Uncertainty Engine | ✅ Enhanced | `uncertainty.py` with `apply_uncertainty()`, risk levels |
| KB Resolver | ✅ Enhanced | `kb_resolver.py` with `KBContext`, domain fragments |
| Prompt Variations | ✅ New | `build_variation_prompts()` in `prompt_builder.py` |
| Consensus Handler | ✅ New | `handle_enrich_consensus` in `handlers.py` |
| HEALTH Service | ✅ Complete | 5 files in `app/health/` |
| SCORE Service | ✅ Complete | 6 files in `app/score/` |
| CI/CD Pipelines | ✅ Complete | 13 workflow files in `.github/workflows/` |
| Test Coverage | ✅ Expanded | 54 test files (was 1) |
| L9 Chassis Contract | ✅ Implemented | `chassis_contract.py`, `handlers.py` |

| Category | Total Gaps | Closed | Remaining |
|----------|------------|--------|-----------|
| ENRICH Engine Internal | 8 | 5 | 3 |
| Convergence Loop Structural | 4 | 2 | 2 |
| GRAPH Engine Service | 5 | 1 | 4 |
| ENRICH ↔ GRAPH Integration | 5 | 1 | 4 |
| Downstream Services | 6 | 2 | 4 |
| Infrastructure | 6 | 2 | 4 |
| Testing | 4 | 2 | 2 |
| **TOTAL** | **38** | **15** | **23** |

**Overall Progress:** ~40% of identified gaps closed

## Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-03-30 | Merge Enrichment-Deployment-pack into WaterfallEngine | L9 architecture compliance — single chassis ingress |
| 2026-03-30 | Add consensus-mode enrichment via `handle_enrich_consensus` | Enables multi-variation LLM synthesis with field-level voting |
| 2026-03-30 | Create `KBContext` dataclass for KB resolution | Structured context injection for domain-specific prompts |

## Open Questions

1. **PostgreSQL persistence strategy** — Use SQLAlchemy async or raw asyncpg?
2. **Event bus choice** — Redis Streams vs NATS for inter-service events?
3. **Multi-provider LLM priority** — OpenAI first or Anthropic for consensus diversity?

## Test Status

```
Unit Tests:      50 passing
Integration:      8 passing
Compliance:       4 passing
Total:           62 passing
```

Last run: 2026-03-30 (GMP-ENRICH-001 completion)

## Next Steps

See `TODO.md` for prioritized task list.

**Immediate priorities:**
1. PostgreSQL persistence layer (`pg_store.py`)
2. Event emitter for downstream service notifications
3. Async task queue for batch enrichment
