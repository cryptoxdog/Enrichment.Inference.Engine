"""
app/services/score/scorer.py
SCORE service — consumes ENRICH field_confidence + GRAPH affinity.
Computes multi-dimensional entity scores: fit, intent, engagement, readiness, graph_affinity.

Readiness score is ENRICH-derived (field coverage + confidence).
graph_affinity is added by the GRAPH node in Phase 3 of the roadmap.
