"""
Adaptive variation budget controller.

Decides how many Sonar calls to fire per entity based on:
  1. Target field completeness (how many fields are we missing?)
  2. Entity richness (how much context do we have to research with?)
  3. Prior confidence (if re-enriching, was last confidence low?)

Output: integer 2–max_variations.
Higher = more API cost, better consensus quality.
Lower = cheaper, sufficient for well-known entities.

Audit fixes:
  - M8: Inspects ALL entity fields, not just 3 hardcoded ones.
  - H3: Returns 2 minimum (not 3), respects engine output.
