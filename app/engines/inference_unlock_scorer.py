"""
Inference Unlock Scorer — computes enrichment targeting based on rule dependencies.

Core insight: not all missing fields are equal. A field that unlocks 5 inference rules
(enabling derived fields like materialgrade, facilitytier, applicationclass) has
10-100x more value than a field with the same scoring_weight that unlocks zero rules.

The unlock index is a DAG: field → rules → output_fields → downstream_rules.
This module walks that graph to compute per-field unlock potential.

Used by meta_prompt_planner.py to rank Pass 2+ enrichment targets.
